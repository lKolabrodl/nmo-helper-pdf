# Algorithm

## Input

`npm run predict` accepts either a JSON request file or CLI flags.

JSON shape:

```json
{
  "pdfPath": "doc.pdf",
  "question": "Question text",
  "answers": [
    { "id": "A", "text": "Option 1" },
    { "id": "B", "text": "Option 2" }
  ],
  "mode": "single"
}
```

CLI examples:

```bash
npm run predict -- --input request.json
npm run predict -- --pdf __test__/35-cron/doc.pdf --question "..." --mode single --answer A="..." --answer B="..."
```

## Output

The predictor returns machine-readable JSON:

- `selected`: selected answer ids;
- `mode`: `single` or `multi`;
- `confidence`: calibrated confidence for the selected answer/set;
- `scores`: calibrated score per answer id;
- `rawScores`: uncalibrated evidence score per answer id;
- `evidence`: PDF snippets with page, answer id, evidence kind, and score;
- `meta`: PDF page/chunk count and detected question intent.

## Runtime Pipeline

1. Extract PDF text page-by-page with `pdfjs-dist`.
2. Detect low-text PDFs and expose `meta.ocrNeeded`; no OCR is run.
3. Normalize text:
   - Unicode NFKC;
   - lowercase;
   - `ё/е`;
   - dash, punctuation, decimal, range, and whitespace cleanup;
   - safe Cyrillic/Latin lookalike folding for mixed medical/PDF text;
   - Greek-letter aliases: `α/β/γ` and Russian `альфа/бета/гамма` are folded to the same `alpha/beta/gamma` search forms;
   - bracketed numeric reference marks such as `[151].` are removed before search tokenization when they appear before sentence punctuation or end-of-text;
   - light Russian suffix stemming;
   - preservation of numbers, percentages, dosages, and common medical abbreviations.
   - one-character numeric tokens such as `1` and `2` are kept, because they distinguish dosage/frequency patterns like `500 мг x 1` vs `500 мг x 2`.
4. Build chunks:
   - page-level text;
   - paragraph/sentence sliding windows;
   - line and line-pair chunks;
   - heading/list context chunks.
5. Index chunks with an in-repo BM25 implementation.
6. Score each answer with non-LLM evidence signals:
   - `question_answer_phrase`;
   - `answer_after_question`;
   - `answer_window` / `answer_directional_window`;
   - `question_anchor_segment`;
   - `question_prefix_continuation`;
   - `focused_answer_window` for answer hits inside narrow windows that also contain distinctive question-condition tokens;
   - `section_list_segment` for `по <section>` list questions, binding answers to the matching section until the next `По ...` heading;
   - `row_label_segment` for explicit row/list labels in the question, including `МКБ-10 ... кодируется`, stage labels, localized/generalized/rare forms, and age-form labels;
   - `classification_code_segment` for code/MKB questions: an answer code is matched to its own PDF row/window, with OCR normalization for extracted `J` codes such as `.140` and `Л41`;
   - `mkb_class_exclusion_absent` for narrow MKB class exclusion questions: options found in member rows such as `C44.0`/`C44.1` are treated as included in the class, while absent options answer `not included` wording;
   - `polarity_match` / `polarity_mismatch` for increase/decrease and more/less direction near the answer term;
   - `latin_fuzzy_ocr` for multi-answer Latin tokens degraded by PDF OCR/extraction noise;
   - `label_number_proximity` for category/range questions such as severity labels followed by numeric ranges;
   - `short_label_visual_row` and `short_label_exact_row` for compact TNM/roman labels such as `T4`, `T0`, `N0`, and `III/IV`, using nearby coordinate-extracted PDF lines, adjacent pages, and exact label-row continuation when available;
   - `cloze_gap_local` for single-answer blank count questions where the right side of the blank contains `раз/сутки/прием` cues; this uses local line windows, small Russian number aliases, question-number proximity, and contrast penalties to avoid neighboring dose alternatives;
   - `visual_table_column` for multi-answer severity/classification tables: the scorer finds the question's column label in PDF `lineItems` by x-coordinate, then accepts an answer only when its metric token and fully covered numeric/range value appear in that same column;
   - `coordinate_table_row` for single-answer table/classification questions: the scorer groups PDF `lineItems` into x-separated cells, merges nearby row continuations, rejects recommendation/comment metadata rows, and scores the answer only when its cell has enough table context and distinctive question-focus support;
   - `gene_sentence_segment` for mutation/polymorphism gene questions: short Latin gene-symbol answers are matched inside the single sentence that contains the question focus, including OCR variants such as Cyrillic lookalike genes and spaced digit forms;
   - `clinical_feature_segment` for narrow `has following clinical signs` multi questions: positive feature sentences near the form/disease focus are boosted, while same-sentence `not typical/not characteristic/absent` cues become `clinical_feature_negated` penalties;
   - `bounded_list_segment` for local list evidence tied to syndrome names, age clauses, and `triad` cues;
   - `ordinal_list_segment` for numbered stages, therapy-line questions, and numeric `N-я ступень` step lists, including page-break continuation; heading-like `терапия N-й линии` windows are narrowed so previous-line drugs do not leak into the current line;
   - `answer_ordinal_row` for answer options that are themselves stage/degree labels (`1/2/3`, `I/II/III`) and must be bound back to the matching classification row; Roman labels require token boundaries so `I` does not match the start of `II`/`III`;
   - `label_definition_segment` for questions like `считается <label> при ...`;
   - `recommendation_polarity_match` for narrow negative-recommendation questions;
   - `explicit_recommendation_target_segment` / `explicit_recommendation_target_mismatch` for multi questions about `назначение`, `проведение`, `проводить`, or `выполнение` a specific target; the answer must be supported by the recommendation block for that target, and confident hits in neighboring recommendation blocks get a mild penalty;
   - `frequency_recommendation_line` with stricter unit matching for `дни` vs `сутки`;
   - `conditioned_number_segment` and `numeric_condition_*` for tightly scoped condition/value rows such as `2-я неделя -> 0,05`, `20-30 кг -> 60 мг`, and phase abbreviations like `ХФ/ФА/БК -> 400/600 мг`;
   - `count_relation_segment` for single-answer count questions whose variants are short numeric answers, binding the number to local count/relation cues and question focus while ignoring long biomedical answers that only contain incidental numeric tokens;
   - `contrast_cue_mismatch` for multi-answer variants whose strongest evidence contains the opposite cue, such as upper vs lower/basal, increased vs decreased, or distal-proximal vs proximal-distal order;
   - `coordinate_table_group` for multi-answer rows in explicit PDF tables: coordinate-extracted left labels are bound to right-side value cells, row continuations are merged, compound labels such as `X/Y` must match all question-focus parts, and numeric-only matches are rejected unless there is lexical or synonym support;
   - `coordinate_table_group_inverse` for the opposite table shape, when the question describes the right-side value cell and the answer option is the left-side label;
   - `coordinate_table_multicell_row` for explicit table rows where one row contains several answerable values across multiple cells/continuation lines; it checks row category cues such as severity, rejects generic header rows, and verifies numeric direction compatibility for expressions like `до 120` vs `более 120`;
   - `roman_stage_segment` for table-style roman stage rows under a `Стадия` heading, including questions written as `II стадия`;
   - `temporal_cue_match` / `temporal_cue_mismatch` for single-answer day/night cues;
   - `bm25_question_answer`;
   - `question_chunk_answer`;
   - `answer_chunk_question`.
   Recent retained row-level signals also include `type_ordinal_segment`, `term_definition_segment`, `recommendation_item_segment`, `drug_dose_segment`, and `fibrosis_stage_row` for tightly scoped type/order, definition, recommendation-row, dose-frequency, and fibrosis-stage row binding. `term_definition_segment` now also handles `X называют...` definition-style multi questions and requires exact in-window abbreviation evidence when an answer option contains an uppercase abbreviation. The fibrosis scorer now also handles METAVIR `F0-F4` descriptor rows such as absent fibrosis, septa-based F2/F3 descriptions, and cirrhosis. Phrase generation also includes safe variants for answers split around hyphens in PDFs and for `ингибиторы <ABBR>` options that may appear as compact `и<ABBR>` text in guidelines.
   `exact_answer_phrase` is deliberately narrow: it only boosts single-answer oral-dose prompts such as `назначение ... внутрь по`, requires a full multi-number answer phrase in the PDF, and still checks local question-focus tokens.
   A small route synonym dictionary maps high-confidence administration-route forms inside table evidence: `per os`/`внутрь` to peroral, `в/в` to intravenous, `в/м` to intramuscular, and `п/к` to subcutaneous.
7. Combine evidence into raw answer scores.
8. Apply a frozen non-LLM feature layer over the evidence kinds:
   - small structural evidence bonuses for reliable row/table/code/list scorers;
   - pairwise single-answer contrast when the top two raw scores are near-tied and one candidate has much stronger structural support;
   - conservative multi-answer cardinality adjustments;
   - an all-options guard for 3- and 4-option multi questions, because selecting every option is almost always an over-selection in this corpus;
   - a crowded-tail guard for 4-option multi questions where 3 answers were selected but the third and fourth raw scores are nearly tied; this trims the ambiguous tail to top-2 rather than treating a weak 3-of-4 set as reliable;
   - structural group completion for explicit multi-cell table rows: if two selected answers are supported by the same reconstructed row, a weaker candidate from that same row can be added when it has strong structural evidence;
   - generic structural-cluster pruning for recommendation-like multi questions, gated away from broad list/source/dose-regimen patterns;
   - generic-population adjustment for multi recommendations, applied only when a broad population answer has a more specific same-population alternative among the options.
9. Calibrate scores with relative spread and a softmax-like transform.
10. Select:
   - `single`: highest raw score, except for a conservative near-tie specificity tie-break when top-1/top-2 raw scores are almost equal;
   - `multi`: answers passing absolute, relative, or score-gap thresholds.
11. In `multi` mode, apply a filtered shared-segment boost: if strong selected candidates point to the same high-quality segment, another candidate can be lifted only when it also matches that segment and already has enough prior raw support. This reduces under-selection while avoiding the broad extra-answer regression seen in earlier experiments.

## Code Layout

- `src/cli.ts`: predict CLI and JSON/flag input parsing.
- `src/predictor.ts`: scoring orchestration, score combination, and the remaining legacy scorers.
- `src/predictor/config.ts`: shared predictor thresholds.
- `src/predictor/constants.ts`: shared stopword/label constants.
- `src/predictor/runtime.ts`: PDF extraction cache and input answer normalization.
- `src/predictor/text-utils.ts`: shared phrase, token, evidence, proximity, and number helpers.
- `src/predictor/scorers/search.ts`: anchor, section, phrase, and row-label retrieval scorers.
- `src/predictor/scorers/drug-dose.ts`: drug/dose/frequency row scorer.
- `src/predictor/scorers/exact-answer.ts`: narrow exact full-answer scorer for oral dose prompts.
- `src/predictor/scorers/frequency.ts`: frequency/duration recommendation scorer.
- `src/predictor/scorers/recommendation-item.ts`: narrow recommendation item scorer.
- `src/predictor/scorers/fibrosis-stage.ts`: fibrosis/METAVIR stage row scorer.
- `src/predictor/types.ts`: answer/evidence score contracts.
- `src/predictor/selection.ts`: score calibration and single/multi selection.
- `src/pdf.ts`, `src/chunk.ts`, `src/bm25.ts`, `src/normalize.ts`: extraction, chunking, retrieval, and normalization utilities.
- `scripts/export-features.ts`: offline feature exporter for future non-LLM calibration experiments. It calls predictor with diagnostics enabled, but writes only abstract numeric/categorical evidence features, never question text, answer text, or PDF text.
- `scripts/calibrator-experiment.ts`: offline logistic-calibrator experiment over exported features. It is not used by runtime predictor and currently does not produce frozen weights.

Current selection thresholds:

- single specificity tie-break: top-2 can replace top-1 only when raw gap is `<= 0.2`, top-2 is at least `0.94 * topRaw`, and its generic specificity score is higher by `>= 0.5`
- multi relative threshold: `0.84 * maxRaw`
- multi absolute threshold: `12`
- multi gap threshold: `0.72`
- minimum selected answers in `multi` mode: `2`
- third-answer near-tie inclusion: add the third answer when it is within `0.45` raw score of the second and at least `0.55 * maxRaw`
- all-options guard: when `multi` selects every option and there are exactly 3 or 4 options, reduce to the top-2 raw candidates; 5+ option all-selected cases are left unchanged
- crowded-tail guard: when a 4-option multi question selects 3 answers, reduce to top-2 only if the third selected answer is separated from the unselected fourth by less than `0.3` raw score and the top answer is not tied with the second
- shared segment boost: enabled, with a raw prior ratio floor before any candidate can be lifted.
- frozen feature ranker, multi-cardinality model, pairwise contrast, and structural-cluster adjustments are enabled; all use fixed local coefficients and evidence kinds only.

## Diagnostic Feature Export

`predict()` supports an optional `diagnostics: true` development flag. This flag does not change scoring or selection. It only returns per-answer evidence summaries:

- evidence count;
- unique evidence page count;
- best evidence score;
- evidence-kind counts;
- best score by evidence kind.

The public default output remains unchanged. The exporter uses these summaries to create offline rows for safe calibrator research. The generated `features` object intentionally excludes raw texts, PDF identifiers, case identifiers, and answer identifiers; those values are metadata only.

## Non-LLM Guarantee

Runtime files under `src/` use only Node.js, local TypeScript modules, and `pdfjs-dist`. They do not import eval files, answer keys, split files, network clients, LLM APIs, transformer inference, or external AI services.

`npm test` includes leakage checks for `src/predictor.ts`, `src/predictor/**/*.ts`, and `src/cli.ts`.

## Known Limitation

The main remaining limitation is layout semantics. Many NMO PDFs contain tables and compact recommendation lists; after `pdfjs-dist` extraction, mutually exclusive rows and answer values often become one flat paragraph. The current text-only algorithm can retrieve the right area and now handles several row-like patterns, but it still cannot always reconstruct which value belongs to which row, condition, heading, or list item.
